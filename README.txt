Navigation for Website:

[Index]
Click on any one of the three logos to go to a page on that specific Console. The website will tell you about the console and suggests 5 of the top genres for that console. Also clicking on the logo for the website (clicking on "Game Finder") will bring you back to the index at any time.

[Switch / Xbox / Playstation]
These all have the same navigation idea. You click on one of the Genres to go straight to the web store for that console, and you will be able to pick from games from your chosen category. Do bear in mind that for the Xbox web store, the genres do not generate separate links on that website, so unfortunately all 5 xbox options bring you to the same page, but on the left hand side of the screen if you scroll down you will find the genres you were able to choose from on this website. The other two stores bring you straight to the genre you selected.
